step 1 - find main effects
step 2 - find squared terms
step 3 - find interactions
step 4 - if a quantitative main effect is in a interaction
		remove it from tempsat
step 5 - if a categorical main effect is in a interaction
		remove all of the levels of the main effect from tempsat
step 6 - if a squared term is in a interaction
		remove it from tempsat
step 7 - if a squared term exists
		remove its main effect from tempsat
