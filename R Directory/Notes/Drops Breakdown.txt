Drops Breakdown

Takes in: 
	mod1 - current LM model
	X - list of all main effect variables
	
***Start of Drops***

np <- nrow(coef(summary(mod1)))

* Gets the number of rows in mod1, 
  this will include the intercept row, 
  so if there a total of 9 main effects/interactions/squared terms, 
  then np will be 10 to account for the intercept

* This means there are 2 routes from here, 
  either will equal 2 for a single variable plus the intercept
  or np will be greater than 2
  meaning a term will need to be dropped

if(np == 2){

	new.mod <- update(mod1, ~ 1)
	* This line updates mod1 to just be predicted by a 1,
	  in other words, it removes the last predictor variable

	res <- list(formula = paste(Yname,"~ 1"), model = new.mod, drop = attr(terms(mod1), "term.labels"), 
		inf.crit = round(inf(new.mod, inform), digits = digits))}
	* This line creates a list that will be returned at the end of the drops function
	  Contained in the list is:
		$formula - The formula after the update was run, meaning it will be of the form: response ~ 1
		$model - The lm model of the formula
 		$drop - The last predictor variable in mod1
		$inf.crit - Measure of the relative quality of the current model using the criterion the user has chosen

if(np > 2){

	sumsat <- coef(summary(mod1))[2:np,]
	* This will produce a matrix of all the current predictor variables
	  The name of the row will be the variable
	  The 3rd column will be the variables t-value

	drop1 <- rownames(sumsat)[which(abs(sumsat[,3]) == min(abs(sumsat[,3])))]
	* This will set drop1 to be the name of the variable with the lowest magnitude t-value

	mod.terms <- attr(terms(mod1), "term.labels")
	* This will create a list of all the possible predictor variables in the current model

	if(any(X==drop1) & length(grep(drop1, mod.terms[mod.terms!=drop1]))>0){
	* This if statement first checks whether drop1 is a main effect
	  The next part checks to see if there are any instances of the variable remaining in the list of all variables
	  If there are instances of the main effect still, the length will be greater than 0

	drop1 <- redo(drop1, sumsat)$drop1
	* This line will get a new drop1 using the redo function

	f1 <- as.formula(paste(c(paste(Yname,"~ 1 "), mod.terms[mod.terms!=drop1]), collapse=" + "))
	*  This will make a new formula in the form: 
	   	response ~ 1 + all the predictor variables excluding what drop is

	new.mod <- lm(f1, data= data)
	* This line will create a new LM model using the formula created in the previous line 

	res <- list(formula = paste(c(paste(Yname,"~ 1 "), mod.terms[mod.terms!=drop1]), collapse=" + "), 
                    model = new.mod, drop = drop1, inf.crit = round(inf(new.mod, inform), digits = digits))
	* This line creates a list that will be returned at the end of the drops function
	  Contained in the list is:
		$formula - The new formula of all the predictor variables excluding drop1
		$model - The lm model of the formula
		$drop - The term that was dropped from the previous lm model
		$inf.crit - Measure of the relative quality of the current model using the criterion the user has chosen

Returns: 
	res
	* This will contain slightly different information depending on if there were 1 predictor variable remaining,
	  or if there were more than 1.
	* The format of res is the same in both instances however
