Agenda 

1. fix variable names in get.higher.order
2. fix variable names in get.names.matrix
3. fix variable names in get.clean.model
4. change method names to better names
5. make sure get.names.matrix works with glm's
6. analyze crabs dataset
7. add crabs dataset to excel spreadsheets
8. get stepAIC times for all models
9. combine greedy and stepAIC results into one spreadsheet
10. make graphs showing difference in times
11. make a dataset from results of greedy and stepAIC
12. analyze new dataset and add it to spreadsheets
13. make centering work by passing in a vector of the names of the columns to be centered
14. in AIC differences in greedy and stepAIC, find 5 models with the widest difference and find out 
    where the differences occured.
