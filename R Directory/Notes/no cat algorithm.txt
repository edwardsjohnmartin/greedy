General Algorithm when there are no categorical variables

1) get steps
2) create a matrix with 3 columns with 'steps' rows
3) set the names of the columns to "Model", "Drop", inform
4) create a lm model of the formula that was passed into greedy
5) create a list of all the main effect terms in squared form - ex. V1 -> I(V1^2)
6) create a list of all the interaction terms
7) combine the 3 lists together into a single list Xall: 
	X - all main effect terms
	Xint - all interaction terms
	Xsq - all squared terms
8) create a formula with the Y term predicted by 1 + Xall
9) create a lm using the formula

Within Drops

1) get number of rows of coefficients of the summary of the lm (this will include the intercept)
 
 -as long as there is more than just the intercept-
2) create a coefficient matrix, sumsat, of all the rows excluding the intercept 
 note: each row of sumsat is either a main effect, an interaction, or a squared term
       in other words, each row is another item of Xall
3) create a list, mod.terms, of all terms in the current model
4) find the term, drop1, in sumsat with the lowest t-value
5) create a new formula with mod.terms excluding drop1
6) fit a new model to the formula
7) return a list of the new formula, the new model, the term that was dropped, and the AIC value of the model
