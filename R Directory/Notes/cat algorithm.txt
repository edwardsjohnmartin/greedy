General Algorithm when there are categorical variables

1) get steps
2) create a matrix with 3 columns with 'steps' rows
3) set the names of the columns to "Model", "Drop", inform
4) create a lm model of the formula that was passed into greedy
5) create a list of all the main effect terms in squared form - ex. V1 -> I(V1^2)
6) create a list of all the interaction terms
7) combine the 3 lists together into a single list Xall: 
	X - all main effect terms
	Xint - all interaction terms
	Xsq - all squared terms
8)
