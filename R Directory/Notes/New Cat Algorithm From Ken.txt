Goal: To understand the new code given to me by Ken Aho and to utilize the code to come up with an algorithm to meet the goals of the greedy function

We start by creating some variables. 
We will have a Y response variable
XC1 Categorical Variable
XC2 Categorical Variable
XC3 Categorical Variable
XQ1 Quantitative Variable

model <- lm(Y ~ XC1 * XC2)

data <- get_all_vars(model)
-Creates a data frame that contains the data used by the model

m <- model.frame(model, data = data)
-Creates a data frame that contains the data used by the model

Y <- model.extract(m, "response")
-Creates a list of just the response column of the data for the model

terms <- terms(m)
-Breaks down the model into a few categories 
"variables" 
"factors"
"term.labels"
"order"
"intercept"
"response"
".Enviroment"
"predvars"
"dataClasses"

X <- attr(terms,"term.labels")
-Creates a list of the variables in the model as well as their interactions

d <- attr(terms,"dataClasses")[2:(length(X)+1)]
d <- d[complete.cases(d)]
-Creates a list of the variables in the model as well as their class type
-If there is anything in the list that is NA, it will remove it from the list

Xn <- X[match(names(d)[d == "numeric"],X)]
-Creates a list of just the numberic variables

Xc <- X[match(names(d)[d == "factor"],X)]
-Creates a list of just the categorical variables

order.lvl <- attr(terms,"order")

higher <- X[order.lvl > 1]
-Creates a list of all the terms in X that are at least order level 2

no.lvls <- apply(data[,match(Xc, names(data))],2,function(x)nlevels(as.factor(x)))

if(length(higher) > 0) ints <- get.higher.order(higher)
